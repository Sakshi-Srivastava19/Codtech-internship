Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every aspect of our lives â€” from virtual assistants and recommendation systems
to self-driving cars and smart diagnostics in healthcare. As the technology advances, it raises questions about ethics,
regulation, and its long-term impact on employment and society at large.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and making decisions. AI systems utilize techniques like machine learning and deep learning to process data, identify patterns,
and make predictions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. The field is rapidly evolving, with applications ranging
from voice assistants and recommendation systems to medical diagnosis and self-driving cars
